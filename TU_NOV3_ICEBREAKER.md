### Questions

Use the microbit [Voting Machine](https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/voting-machine) program to ask students a set of Yes/No questions. For those that answer Yes, ask them to explain in their own words.

1. Do you know the name of the building you are in?
1. Do you know what is a Computer Programmer?
1. Do you know what is a microbit?
1. Do you know how to play Rock, Paper, Scissors?

### Play Rock, Paper Scissors

* Girls pair up to play Rock, Paper, Scissors. Play 3 rounds, and who is the winner?
* Ask them to think about how a computer would determine the winner or loser of a round; perhaps make a flow chart of the decisions.
* Use microbit to play [Rock Paper Scissors](https://makecode.microbit.org/projects/rock-paper-scissors).
