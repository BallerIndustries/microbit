# Path Chaser

Build a game where you need to bring a moving dot (path chaser) to a fixed position on the board - let's call it a portal. The moving dot will move in the direction that the microbit board is tilted.

### Step 1
Starting point in the game - let's place the portal in a random position on hte board, and the moving dot in the middle.
> We can turn on or off a single point on the board without modifying the other lights by using the "plot" and "unplot" options in hte LED menu.
